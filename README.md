<h1> DurableMaintainance </h1>

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Games Studio, Inc.

Based on WulfMarius' <a href="https://github.com/WulfMarius/Durable-Whetstone">Durable-Whetstone</a>, this mod increases the durability of whetstones and firearm cleaning kits by reducing the wear to an adjustable 1-10% per use, making the game more/less difficult depending on your preference. Settings are <i>only</i> changeable through the main menu, not the in-game menu.
